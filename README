Installing the kernel module.
-----------------------------

First you need to install kernel development environment on your system.

On a debian or ubuntu this is as simple as (as root):
# apt-get install dkms

You can then descend into the awusb/ directory and just run:
# make
# make install
# depmod -a

Load the module by running:
# modprobe awusb

Installing the kernel module by DKMS
-----------------------------

First you need to install dkms on your system.

Copy module source to sources directory
# mkdir -p /usr/src/awusb-0.5
# cp -R awusb /usr/src/awusb-0.5

Add module to DKMS 
# dkms add -m awusb -v 0.5

Build and install
# dkms build -m awusb -v 0.5
# dkms install -m awusb -v 0.5

Remove if neaded
# dkms remove -m awusb/0.5 --all


Running LiveSuit.
-----------------

Just run the top level script (may be as superuser, depends on the rights to usb ):
> ./LiveSuit.sh

This will determine whether your system is x86 or x86-64 and will then
start the right binary.

Flashing your device.
---------------------

Warning: if you attach your FEL enabled device before you start
LiveSuit, then LiveSuit will not detect it. You need to first start the
LiveSuit application.

First, properly power down the device by either pressing and holding the
power button for about 10 seconds, or by cutting all power in case of
development board.

Start LiveSuit and select an image for flashing, if you haven't already
done so.

Then, hold the FEL button, and power up the device. Either by attaching
the power lead, or by pressing the power button for 1-2s and then
pressing and releasing the power button several times in quick
succession. This will have made your device enter FEL mode.

Now attach the USB OTG lead. LiveSuit should now detect your device and
start flashing.
